# Recommendation System Experiment Notes
### üí™ Motivation
A recommendation system is a type of machine learning system that filters through a large amount of information and recommends those that are most relevant to a particular user. It is a tool that helps users discover new products, services, content, or people based on their past behavior and preferences. Recommendation systems are widely used in many different industries, including e-commerce, streaming services, social media, and music.<br />
<br />
This guide will walk you through the process of building a recommender system from scratch, using the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset as experimental data.
### üéØ Goal
The goal is to create a system that can rival the performance of Xiaohongshu's recommendation engine.
